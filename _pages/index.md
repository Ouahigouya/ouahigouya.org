Thank you for this opportunity to share information about
[The Ouahigouya Organization](.).

We are a [Delaware Series LLC](./llc)
which operates or advises a set of
[Dignified Data Exchanges](./glossary#dignified-data-exchange) (DDEs).

Please [browse our Portfolio](./portfolio) to explore our
inventory of exchanges.

If you are interested in learning more or engaging in some
other way, please say hello via one of our
[onboarding workflows](./engage).

## The Big Picture

We use [Bougouriba/Dignified Data Ecosystem Reference Implementation](.)
to operate the [Ouahigouya/Core](./core)
[Dignified Data Exchange](./glossary#dignified-data-exchange).

As a series element of Ouahigouya, the [Ouahigouya/Core](./core) entity
is a limited liability software development company formed for the following
purpose:
  1. delivers a cloud-deployable (tentative) layer 4 ToIP ecosystem
  2. operates an instance of the product at a domain
  3. offers professional consulting services and community engagement
  4. provides patches against the open-source product to allow
     freedom of debugging and development.
  5. provides a legal and financial infrastructure for operating the
     reference implementation (2,1), and maintaining the code (4), and
     providing consulting linking the general community (3)



Each instance of the Core code enables a coherent DNS backed network API.
This is the boundary of the DDE,

Every other element of the organization, such as
[Ouahigouya/Verifiable Contractor](.)
or
[Ouahigouya/Veterinary Passport](.)
are operations companies which operate or advise
legally independent cloud deployments of the Core,
backed by independent financial accounts and data governance frameworks,
trade associations, regulators, and other relevant bodies.

This is delivered as a [docker, then to kubernetes] configuration
and contracts can be arranged for professional services, co-development,
and other arrangements

The operational commitments of each [DDE](.), including the subscriptions
to supporting cloud service providers, are defined in a template SLA which
is managed

also an independent legal entity which connects a
legal incorporation framework with a
[ToIP inspired](.)
[data governance framework](./glossary#data-governance-framework).

The ToIP Recommendations specify machine readability in the form of a
Decision Support System or Rules Engine, meaning that the machine and
human readable rules that define dignity in our dignified data ecosystem
map to specific text legal text, precedence, and unknowns.



We practice an engineering technique called
[dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food).
Using our own software ensures that our engineers, members,
and potential partners have a deep and common understanding of
how it feels to use a
[DDE](./glossary#dignified-data-exchange).

Please [join us](./engage) and build your own universe of trust.

## What does the organization do?

[Bougouriba Devops](.) operates
[The Ouahigouya Organization](.)'s
[DDE](./glossary#dignified-data-exchange).

In order to access the organization, you need to become a
signatory to the data governance framework and receive a
[Client Communications Certificate](./glossary#client-communications-certificate).

This can be accomplished by one of the
[onboarding workflows](./engage).  Each workflow will
collect the required KYC and help adapt your portion
of the terms and conditions.

Your capacity to participate in the terms and conditions by which you
engage the [DDE](./glossary#dignified-data-exchange)
is a key component of [digital dignity](./glossary#digital-dignity).

In fact, as a signatory possessing a
[Client Communications Certificate](./glossary#client-communications-certificate),
you will be able to acknowledge delivery of consent receipt detailing
the mutually accepted terms-and-conditions.  Upon acknowledgement of
your consent, you are free to help steer the community via the community's
[Agile Legislation](./technology/agile-legislation) process and utilities.

When using the DDE, please imagine how you can adapt this to your
industry or business problem, then drop us a line or work through our
[problem definition wizard](.).
