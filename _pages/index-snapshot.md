[Ouahigouya LLC](./llc) provides boutique software solutions and
[custom partnerships](./portfolio) addressing global
[identity](./glossary#identity), [credential](./glossary#credential),
and [trust](./glossary#trust) challenges.  Our solutions are
custom implementations of the [Ouahigouya Core](./core)
technology stack.  [Ouahigouya Core](./core) is based upon
[Iiolonioro Blueprints](./io/blueprints), a process specification
for generating [ToIP](http://trustoverip.org) inspired
[Trust Ecosystems](./glossary#trust-ecosystems).  Our boutique
solutions
deploy [Partner Platforms](./partner),
[Open Source Projects](./foss), and [Open Standards](./standards)
as appropriate to realize industry and problem specific
[Dignified Data Exchanges](./glossary#dignified-data-exchange).


Ouahigouya Trust Ecosystems are governed by legislation which is modeled
after the Trust over IP Foundation's Metamodel, with additional support
to ensure data exchange always respects applicable digital rights, data
laws, and jurisdiction obligations -- all while maximizing the sovereignty
and digital capabilities of all participants, whether the
[signatory](./glossary#signatory) is a
[government office](./glossary#institution),
[private organization](./glossary#organization),
[managed popuplations](./glossary#managed-populations),
[property](./glossary#property),
or, most importantly,
[self sovereign individual](./glossary#self-sovereign-individual).


Ouahigouya's unique technology uses well established
open source software engineering techniques to ensure that
each community's legislation advances and evolves to the general mutual
benefit of all participants.Ouahigouya's governance toolkit replaces Contracts of Adhesion with Contracts of Inclusion and Dignified Negotiation.


The governance framework, or legislation, which defines a
[Dignified Data Exchange](./glossary#dignified-data-exchange),

 and actively maintained by the
community using  authored by a community of
  * [Trade Associations](./glossary#trade-association),
  * [Jurisdiction Representatives](./glossary#jurisdiction-representative),
  * [Registered Service Providers](/glossary#registered-service-provider)
and any other relevant organizations or individuals.

Each [Trust Ecosystems](./glossary#trust-ecosystems) is implemented
as a transparent legal entity
the [Ouahigouya Core](./core) improve
the operation of information exchanges which are
  * small in scale (<= 100's of entities)
  * economically mature (are currently functioning)
  * limited in scope (<= 1000 credential types)
  * pragmatically governed (usually by trade or related cooperative
    associations)


Ecosystem participants realize improvements as
  * reduced time and higher confidence in decisions
  * improved data transfer accuracy
  * reduced liability
  * improved forecasting accuracy
  * new revenue streams




[Ouahigouya](./llc)'s' inter-organization data exchange technology respects
the relevant digital data rights, laws, and obligations by rigorously

[organizations](./glossary#organization),
[managed popuplations](./glossary#managed-populations),
[property](./glossary#property),
and, most importantly,
[self sovereign individuals](./glossary#self-sovereign-individuals).

  cryptographically verifiable version control system, with issue discussion
  and resolution tools, and natively supports well known best practices to manage
  forward progress of the legislation as described by the
