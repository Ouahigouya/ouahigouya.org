[Ouahigouya LLC](./llc) provides boutique software solutions via
[custom partnerships](./portfolio) which utilize
[incorporated](./glossary#incorporating)
[Dignified Data Exchanges (DDE)](./glossary#dignified-data-exchange)
to solve
[identity](./glossary#identity), [credential](./glossary#credential),
and [trust](./glossary#trust) challenges.

The incorporated DDE manages a deployment of the
[Ouahigouya Core](./core), which includes [Partner Platforms](./partner),
[Open Source Projects](./foss), [Open Standards](./standards),
and other services required to meet the service level
agreement (SLA) defined in the incorporated DDE's operating agreement.

The DDE thus connects the jurisdiction of an SLA and fully defines
how the SLA's operational commitments translate into legal consequences,
legal liability, financial costs, and financial rewards.

The DDE stakeholders typically include a community of
  * [Trade Associations](./glossary#trade-association),
  * [Jurisdiction Representatives](./glossary#jurisdiction-representative),
  * [Registered Service Providers](/glossary#registered-service-provider)

and any other relevant organizations, individuals, or property.

The DDE's use of the [Ouahigouya Core](./core) defines a  the
world with a neutral cloud service which enforces data access
and exchange according to a [ToIP]()
inspired governance framework, which is defined and managed by
the community of signatories to the


  DDEs define roles, levels of
assurance, degrees of acceptable proof, conditions of consent,
and other policies - for small multi-organization pain points
and domains currently dominated by PDF and printed processess.


DDEs provide reporting mechanisms to monitor
  * documented compliance with regulations
  * sensitivity to local regulations, cultures, and customs.
  * alternative governance for special actors

The  provides a suite of services for the members of the DDE.





Ouahigouya Trust Ecosystems are governed by legislation which is modeled
after the Trust over IP Foundation's Metamodel, with additional support
to ensure data exchange always respects applicable digital rights, data
laws, and jurisdiction obligations -- all while maximizing the sovereignty
and digital capabilities of all participants, whether the
[signatory](./glossary#signatory) is a
[government office](./glossary#institution),
[private organization](./glossary#organization),
[managed popuplations](./glossary#managed-populations),
[property](./glossary#property),
or, most importantly,
[self sovereign individual](./glossary#self-sovereign-individual).


Ouahigouya's unique technology uses well established
open source software engineering techniques to ensure that
each community's legislation advances and evolves to the general mutual
benefit of all participants.Ouahigouya's governance toolkit replaces Contracts of Adhesion with Contracts of Inclusion and Dignified Negotiation.


The governance framework, or legislation, which defines a
[Dignified Data Exchange](./glossary#dignified-data-exchange),

 and actively maintained by the

Each [Trust Ecosystems](./glossary#trust-ecosystems) is implemented
as a transparent legal entity
the [Ouahigouya Core](./core) improve
the operation of information exchanges which are
  * small in scale (<= 100's of entities)
  * economically mature (are currently functioning)
  * limited in scope (<= 1000 credential types)
  * pragmatically governed (usually by trade or related cooperative
    associations)


Ecosystem participants realize improvements as
  * reduced time and higher confidence in decisions
  * improved data transfer accuracy
  * reduced liability
  * improved forecasting accuracy
  * new revenue streams
