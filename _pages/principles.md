This section summarizes the design goals and principles of DID architecture.

#


Principle


Description

1


Decentralization


DID architecture should eliminate the requirement for centralized authorities or single points of failure in identity management, including the registration of globally unique identifiers, public verification keys, service endpoints, and other metadata.

2


Self-Sovereignty


DID architecture should give identity owners the power to directly own and control their own digital identities without the need to rely on external authorities.

3


Privacy


DID architecture should enable identity owners to control the privacy of their digital identities, including selective disclosure of attributes or other identity data.

4


Security


DID architecture should provide sufficient security for relying parties to rely on DID records to their required level of assurance.

5


Cryptography


DID architecture should enable an identity owner to provide cryptographic proof of ownership and proof of access control rights.

6


Discoverability


DID architecture should make it possible for entities to discover DID records for other entities to learn more about or interact with those entities.

7


Interoperability


DID architecture should use interoperable standards so DIDs and DID record infrastructure can make use of existing tools and software libraries designed for interoperability.

8


Portability


DID architecture should be system-independent and enable identity owners to use their digital identities with any system that supports DIDs and DIDM.

9


Simplicity


To meet these design goals, DID architecture should be (to paraphrase Albert Einstein) "as simple as possible but no simpler".

10


Extensibility


When possible, DID architecture should enable extensibility provided it does not hinder interoperability, portability or simplicity.
