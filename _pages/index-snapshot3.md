Thank you for this opportunity to share information about
[The Ouahigouya Organization](.).

We are a [Delaware Series LLC](./llc) which operates a
[Dignified Data Exchange (DDE)](./glossary#dignified-data-exchange)
as an instance of [Ouahigouya Core](./core).

We practice an engineering technique called
[dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food).
Using our own software ensures that our engineers, members,
and potential partners have a deep and common understanding of
how it feels to use a
[DDE](./glossary#dignified-data-exchange).

[Bougouriba Devops](.) operates
[The Ouahigouya Organization](.)'s
[DDE](./glossary#dignified-data-exchange).

In order to access the organization, you need to become a
signatory to the data governance framework and receive a
[Client Communications Certificate](./glossary#client-communications-certificate).

This can be accomplished by one of the
[onboarding workflows](./engage).  Each workflow will
collect the required KYC and help adapt your portion
of the terms and conditions.

Your capacity to participate in the terms and conditions by which you
engage the [DDE](./glossary#dignified-data-exchange)
is a key component of [digital dignity](./glossary#digital-dignity).

In fact, as a signatory possessing a
[Client Communications Certificate](./glossary#client-communications-certificate),
you will be able to acknowledge delivery of consent receipt detailing
the mutually accepted terms-and-conditions.  Upon acknowledgement of
your consent, you are free to help steer the community via the community's
[Agile Legislation](./technology/agile-legislation) process and utilities.

When using the DDE, please imagine how you can adapt this to your
industry or business problem, then drop us a line or work through our
[problem definition wizard](.).

## Details about How it Works

When you join, you join according to a role you wish to play, what liabilities
and resources you will share.  This is your side of the terms and conditions
contract and it establishes an initial relationship.  You are free to evolve
and change this relationship.
