Timelines are views of events thorough time.  Basically it comes down to a
date and a description - but the description has to be "simple enough" that
it can fit on the timeline, and likewise, the dates have to be sparse enough
that the timeline is comprehensible under "appropriate zoom".

Determining a timeline is a bit of an art - a little bit of hack-fu.  GraphQL
provides a pretty cool way to do that, though.... so.... you know... seems
like a fit.

Have no f'ing idea how to do that - so sticking with the menu on the left.
